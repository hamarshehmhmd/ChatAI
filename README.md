# ChatAI


To run this program please make sure you have the following package:

random


This program generates a list of random questions and asks the user for their name. It then asks the user each question and stores their response in a list. Finally, it saves the user's responses to a file with their name.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
